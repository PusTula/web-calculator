# Calculator Project
### Languages
HTML, CSS, JS


### Goal
Mainly to practise layout building and the needed css methods like flexbox, grid.

Also for basic JS practise and DOM manipulation.


### Current State
- Layout	done
- Graphics	done
- Animation	undone
- Logic (JS)	undone


### Future goals
- Edit the code so it's well readable, free of duplication.
- Have a decent animation set so it's use is graphically satisfying.
- Create logical use.


### Mentions
- The favicon was made during a pixel icon creating project, so I just added
it as it's something I made.
- I started as a practice for flexbox and it grown to a quite big project but
as later explored flexbox was not meant for this purpose, so as found out on
stackoverflow the grid method was the solution.
